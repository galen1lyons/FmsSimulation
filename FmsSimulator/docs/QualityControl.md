# FMS Code Quality Control Guidelines

## 1. Performance Metrics
- All operations must log execution time
- Use `OperationResult<T>` for all service methods
- Monitor memory usage in background operations

## 2. Code Standards
- Use singleton pattern for services that need global state
- Implement proper exception handling in all async methods
- Utilize LINQ for efficient data operations
- Use parallel processing for independent operations

## 3. Logging Standards
- Use structured logging through LoggingService
- Include component and operation identifiers
- Log performance metrics for all critical operations

## 4. Error Handling
- All public methods should return OperationResult<T>
- Log exceptions with full context
- Implement retry logic for network operations

## 5. Optimization Guidelines
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use parallel processing where appropriate
- Minimize object allocation in loops

## 6. Memory Management
- Dispose of resources properly
- Use object pooling for frequent allocations
- Monitor memory leaks through logging

## 7. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Load tests for concurrent operations
