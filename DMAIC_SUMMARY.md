## ðŸŽ¯ System Status

### Current Architecture

**Core Services (Active):**
1. ErpConnectorService - ERP integration
2. OptimizedPlanGenerator - Plan generation with constraints
3. OptimizedMcdmEngine - Multi-criteria decision making
4. CommunicationService - VDA 5050 + internal commands
5. LearningService - Feedback loop and model updates
6. WorkflowManager - End-to-end orchestration
7. LoggingService - Operational metrics

**Workflow Phases:**
1. PLANNING â†’ Generate & evaluate plans
2. EXECUTING â†’ Dispatch VDA 5050 orders
3. LEARNING â†’ Update world model
4. State Tracking â†’ Concurrent workflow monitoring

### Tri-Planar Communication âœ…
- **Vertical:** ERP â†” FMS (ISA-95)
- **Horizontal:** FMS â†” AMR Fleet (VDA 5050)
- **Internal:** AMR subsystem commands (Navigation/Lift/Arm)

### Conscious Layer âœ…
- **MCDM Engine:** Exponential decay, non-linear resource modeling
- **Learning Service:** Continuous improvement from feedback
- **Metrics:** Comprehensive operational data collection
